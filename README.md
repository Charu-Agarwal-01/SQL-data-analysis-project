# Sales and Customers analysis using SQL and PowerBI
Welcome to the SQL and PowerBI based data analysis project repository!
The project showcases an end-to-end data transformation, modeling, and analytics solution. Using SQL, raw Customer, Products, and Sales data were cleaned, transformed, and structured to generate actionable insights. These insights were further visualized through interactive dashboards in Power BI, enabling effective decision making and business intelligence.

## Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracting the data for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Transforming, cleaning and preparing the data for visualisation.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports for actionable insights.
5. **PowerBI dashboard**: Creating interactive dashboard to visualise patterns and insights.


#### Objective:
Develop SQL and PowerBI based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Demographics**
- **Products Insights**
- **Sales Performance**


#### Specifications:
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
